# Project scaffolding

Ready to start project scaffolding,
which we only have to clone and modify.

# Familiarity

Close to web's language HTML CSS JS.

# Global helper functions

A lot of global helper functions, such as:

- `file_get_contents`, `file_exists`
- `view`, `redirect`, `abort(404)`
- `cache()->remember(...)`

- Xie: Is this about using namespace?

# High quality free courses

The introduction course has OOD, TDD and refactoring built-in
(The example starts from "shameless green" code).

Thus, learning is also manifold:
- How web works,
- How the framework works,
- How to design good software without too much stress.

- Xie: We may also start from the domain -- DDD.

# Dependency injection container

Type hint and implicit conversion, such as "Route Model Binding".

- Xie: We might not able to use this in typescript project,
  Because "dependency injection by type hint" is too dynamic.

- Xie: But we do need a central way of creating objects,
  where nested dependency injections
  can be given good (config-ed) default values.

# Objectâ€“relational mapping

Relationship between models, such as `belongsTo`.

- Xie: In typescript, we can not use active-record
  without using decorators on class and fields of class.
  Because we can not dynamicly generate well type class.

  But, if we really want easy to use active-record,
  we can use function plus record style OOP to achieve this.

  Alternatively, we can use table module pattern
  instead of active-record.

- Xie: Lavavel migrations (such as creating table) and models are not in the same place.

- Xie: About migrations:

  - (A) We can used well model schema to generate "creating table migration".
    Note that, table schema is more complex than data schema.

  - (B) Use SQL for migration directly.
